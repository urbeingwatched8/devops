Lab1 - created the simplest Python web app using Django and Sqlite3. The Moscow time is showing and is updated with every refresh of the page (simple html&js). I followed the tutorial from Django documentation. The reason I chose Django was that I am familiar with it already. I also looked up the best tactics for showing the current time.
