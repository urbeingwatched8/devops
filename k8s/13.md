The explanation for output:
The output for all 3 is different. This is happening because of Persistent Volume Claims, each are bound to a Persistent Volume. Everything happened as we specified in volumeClaimTemplates - same capacity, same access modes. If all Pods tried to access the same visits file for writing, a mess would happen, but the way we implemented it, they are basically writing to different files. 

Ordering guarantees are unnecessary here. We don't need to terminate pod 0 completely before starting the termination of pod 1, therefore it can happen at the same time. Same with launching. 

I decided to use Parallel Pod Management (podManagementPolicy: "Parallel")
